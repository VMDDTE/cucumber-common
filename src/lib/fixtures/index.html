    <h1>ü•í Cucumber Common Fixtures</h1>
    <p>
      You can use the links below as HTML fixtures for your tests.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:</h2> 
      <p>
        Fixtures are so named as they are FIXED data, do not modify these files as they are likely to break tests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The one exception to this rule is if you want to add a data-hook to an element which doesn't already have one.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an existing fixture is missing something you need, feel free to create a new one and then link to it via the list below.</p>
      <p>
        I recommend you do not use this page for your tests as this page is subject to change
      </p>

    <dl class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <h3><a href="kitchen-sink.html">Kitchen Sink</a></h3>
        <p>
          A 'kitchen sink' HTML page with a ton of stuff from bootstrap.
          It also contains a load of data-hooks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <h3><a href="forms.html">Forms</a></h3>
        <p>
          A page specifically for testing form elements
